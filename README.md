# Hi there 👋

## About this profile: 
- I will upload some smaller projects here
- I will mainly use ☕Java☕ because this is my main language at the moment
- I'm only doing the coding-challenges to get better at developing algorithms because I'm still a beginner. 
  So I concentrate on solving the challenges and don't pay attention to the time I need.

### In Planning: 
* AoC 2022 
  * I may even upload older AoC challenges
* other coding-challenges
* I am trying to document my progress and what resources I use to get better


### My Rescources
* [Coding Bat](https://codingbat.com/) -  some very easy challenges but the hard ones took me a few minutes to complete
* [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
