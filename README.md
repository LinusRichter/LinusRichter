# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

## About this profile: 
- I will upload some smaller projects here
- I will mainly use â˜•Javaâ˜• because this is my main language at the moment
- I'm only doing the coding-challenges to get better at developing algorithms because I'm still a beginner. 
  So I concentrate on solving the challenges and don't pay attention to the time I need.

### In Planning: 
* AoC 2022 
  * I may even upload older AoC challenges
  * [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)
  * ![aocStars](https://github.com/LinusRichter/LinusRichter/blob/main/AoCStars15.PNG)
* Google Code Jam
